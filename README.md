Student Marks Lookup

Description

This Python script allows users to check the marks of a student from a predefined dictionary of student names and their corresponding marks.

How It Works

The script defines a dictionary student_marks containing student names as keys and their marks as values.
It prompts the user to enter a student's name.
If the entered name exists in the dictionary, the script displays the student's marks.
If the name is not found, it notifies the user that the student is not in the records.

Usage

Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter a student's name when prompted.
View the corresponding marks or an error message if the student is not found.

Example

Enter the student's name: Alice
Alice's marks: 85

Enter the student's name: John
Student not found.

Requirements

Python 3.x

Notes

You can modify the student_marks dictionary to include additional students and their marks.
The program performs a case-sensitive lookup; ensure that the input matches the stored names exactly.

List Manipulation Example

Description

This Python script demonstrates basic list operations, including extracting a subset of elements and reversing them.

How It Works

The script defines a list numbers containing integers from 1 to 10.
It extracts the first five elements from the list.
It then reverses the extracted list.
Finally, it prints the original list, the extracted elements, and the reversed extracted elements.

Usage

Run the script in a Python environment.
Observe the printed output, which includes:
The original list.
The first five extracted elements.
The reversed extracted elements.

Example Output

Original list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
Extracted first five elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

Requirements

Python 3.x

Notes

You can modify the range to extract a different subset of elements.
The slicing and reversing operations showcase basic list manipulations in Python.
